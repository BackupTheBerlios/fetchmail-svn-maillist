-  - POP3 connections could retry USER/PASS authentication even if strong

 # BUG FIXES (long-standing bugs):
-* POP3: Probe capabilities when Kerberos V5 is enabled so that we can actually
-  try to use it.
-* RPOP: The password is now shrouded in the local logs.
-* Robustness: If a stale lockfile cannot be deleted, truncate it to avoid
-  trouble later if the PID is recycled by a non-fetchmail process.
-* Detect /etc/resolv.conf changes: On systems that have res_search(), assume we
-  also have res_init() and call it (suggested by Ulrich Drepper, glibc bug
-  #3675) in order to make libc or libresolv reread the resolver configuration at
-  the beginning of a poll cycle.  This is important when fetchmail is in daemon
-  mode and /etc/resolv.conf is changed later by dhcpcd, dhclient, pppd, openvpn
-  or other ip-up/ipchange scripts.  Should fix Debian Bug#389270, Bug#391698.
-* Fix crash on systems that do not provide strdup(), the crash happens only in
-  out-of-memory conditions when fetchmail cannot proceed anyways.  Patch by
-  Andreas Krennmair.
-* When HOME and FETCHMAILHOME are unset, be sure to copy user database
-  information, so it is not trashed later. Patch by Jim Correia.
+* RPOP: used to log the password locally rather than an asterisk as the other
+  protocols do. The password is now shrouded in the local logs.
+* POP3: Probes capabilities now when Kerberos V5 is enabled, so that we can
+  actually detect if the server supports it.
+* Robustness: If a stale lockfile cannot be deleted, truncate it so that
+  fetchmail doesn't later believe itself to be running if the PID is recycled
+  by a non-fetchmail process.
+* DNS: Detect /etc/resolv.conf changes: On systems that have res_search(),

 # CHANGES:
-* Remove excess no-op strcpy() after strdup() found by Andreas Krennmair.
-* Remove handling for PS_TRUNCATED (code 27), which was never returned.
-* Improve handling of IMAP IDLE, some servers do not reset their time counters
-  after sending information asynchronously. Patch by Sunil Shetye, after report
-  from Andrew Baumann.
-* When requesting Kerberos V4, V5 or GSSAPI, complain and exit with syntax error
-  if any of these requested features has not been compiled in. This is to fail
-  early and with precise error message. Reported by Isaac Wilcox.

   been compiled in. Reported missing by Isaac Wilcox.
