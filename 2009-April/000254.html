New Revision: 5270

Modified:
   branches/BRANCH_6-3/fetchmail-FAQ.html
Log:
Revise FAQ G3 (support). Make intro more catchy.

Make the introduction a bit more catchy so as to guide people to G3
right away.

In G3:
- some information was given twice. Remove the duplication.
- Add env LC_ALL=C so that people send in information in English and
  POSIX locale, we cannot handle i18n-ed reports.
- Remove IMAP advocacy. Doesn't belong here, and ESR's IMAP-over-POP3
  advocacy is neither technically substantiated nor warranted today.

 good to have. (Bear in mind that you can attach gdb to a running
