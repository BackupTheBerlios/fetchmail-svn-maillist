+SSL server requirements
+-----------------------
+
+In order to let any mail client (not just fetchmail) verify server
+certificates properly, so that users can be sure their connection is not
+eavesdropped, there are several requirements that need to be fulfilled.
+
+1. Match certificate and DNS names:
+
+   The server certificate's &quot;common name&quot; or &quot;subject alternative name&quot;
+   must match the name by which clients are connecting. Avoid the use of
+   wildmats if possible, not all clients support them (fetchmail does).
+
+   This may sound trivial, but for load balancing and failover setups,
+   it may not be obvious.
+
+2. Provide the *full* certificate chain
+
+   Many SSL documents tell you to install the server certificate,
+   silently assuming that it were directly signed by a trusted
+   root certification authority (CA).
+
+   If your server certificate is not directly signed by the root
+   certification authority (root CA), then you are using intermediate
+   CA. In this case, you *MUST* (as per the TLS standard) provide *ALL*
+   intermediate certificates.
+
+   If you fail to provide intermediate certificates, clients can only
+   connect if the end user overrides/disables security warnings in
+   his/her software, and this disables the detection of eavesdroppers.
+
+   The intermediate CA certificates must be issued after the server's
+   certificate in proper order, that is:
+   first the intermediate CA cert that signed the servers' certificate,
+   then the intermedate CA cert that signed the previous intermediate CA,
+   and all the way back to the root CA cert (which you should omit).
+
+   You can optionally add the root CA certificate, but this is
+   redundant, as the client needs to have that installed anyways (see 3
+   below) in its store of trusted root certification authorities in
+   order to verify certificates that this root CA has signed.
+
+   For software that does not offer &quot;chain certificate&quot; options, but
+   that supports reading certificates in PEM format, it is
+   usually sufficient to concatenate all the certs in proper order
+   (again, from server to root).
+
+3. Provide the *root* CA's certificate separately.
+
+   Provide the root CA's certificate in a place where your end users
+   will quickly and easily find it, or provide a link to it. Depending
+   on which mail software your clients use, it may not be pre-installed,
+   and users require this root CA to verify your SSL server certificate,
+   and possibly intermediate certificates.
+
+   This is particularly important if you're using local self-signed
+   certificates, as these are never preinstalled into end-users clients.
+
+   Your technical support team should have the finger prints of this
+   root CA readily available at least in MD5 and SHA1 formats and offer
+   to clients and be ready to answer client questions as to the
+   fingerprints (for verification) and installation in commonly used
+   clients.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
-.I fetchmail
-is a mail-retrieval and forwarding utility; it fetches mail from
-remote mailservers and forwards it to your local (client) machine's
-delivery system.  You can then handle the retrieved mail using normal
-mail user agents such as \fImutt\fR(1), \fIelm\fR(1) or \fIMail\fR(1).
-The \fIfetchmail\fR utility can be run in a daemon mode to repeatedly
-poll one or more systems at a specified interval.

-If
-.I fetchmail
-is used with a POP or an IMAP server, it has two fundamental modes of
-operation for each user account from which it retrieves mail:
-\fIsingledrop\fR- and \fImultidrop\fR-mode.  In singledrop-mode,
-.I fetchmail
-assumes that all messages in the user's account are intended for a single
-recipient.  An individual mail message will not be inspected for recipient
-information, rather, the identity of the recipient will either default to
-the local user currently executing \fIfetchmail\fR,
-or else will need to be explicitly specified in the configuration file.
-Singledrop-mode is used when the fetchmailrc configuration contains at
-most a single local user specification for a given server account.

+ETRN or ODMR), it has two fundamental modes of operation for each user
+account from which it retrieves mail: \fIsingledrop\fP- and
+\fImultidrop\fP-mode.
+.IP &quot;In singledrop-mode,&quot;
+\fBfetchmail\fP assumes that all messages in the user's account
+(mailbox) are intended for a single recipient.  The identity of the
+recipient will either default to the local user currently executing
+\fBfetchmail\fP, or will need to be explicitly specified in the

+.IP
+\fBfetchmail\fP uses singledrop-mode when the fetchmailrc configuration
+contains at most a single local user specification for a given server
+account.
+.IP &quot;In multidrop-mode,&quot;
+\fBfetchmail\fP assumes that the mail server account actually contains
+mail intended for any number of different recipients.  Therefore,
+\fBfetchmail\fP must attempt to deduce the proper &quot;envelope recipient&quot;
+from the mail headers of each message.  In this mode of operation,
+\fBfetchmail\fP almost resembles a mail transfer agent (MTA).
+.IP
+Note that neither the POP nor IMAP protocols were intended for use in
+this fashion, and hence envelope information is often not directly
+available.  The ISP must stores the envelope information in some message
+header \fBand\fP. The ISP must also store one copy of the message per
+recipient. If either of the conditions is not fulfilled, this process is
+unreliable, because \fBfetchmail\fP must then resort to guessing the
+true envelope recipient(s) of a message. This usually fails for mailing
+list messages and Bcc:d mail, or mail for multiple recipients in your
+domain.
+.IP
+\fBfetchmail\fP uses multidrop-mode when more than one local user and/or
+a wildcard is specified for a particular server account in the
+configuration file.
+.IP &quot;In ETRN and ODMR modes,&quot;
+these considerations do not apply, as these protocols are based on SMTP,
+which provides explicit envelope recipient information. These protocols
+always support multiple recipients.
 .PP
-With multidrop-mode,
-.I fetchmail
-is not able to assume that there is only a single recipient, but rather
-that the mail server account actually contains mail intended for any
-number of different recipients.  Therefore,
-.I fetchmail
-must attempt to deduce the proper &quot;envelope recipient&quot; from the mail
-headers of each message.  In this mode of operation,
-.I fetchmail
-almost resembles an MTA, however it is important to note that neither
-the POP nor IMAP protocols were intended for use in this fashion, and
-hence envelope information is often not directly available.  Instead,
-.I fetchmail
-must resort to a process of informed guess-work in an attempt to
-discover the true envelope recipient of a message, unless the ISP stores
-the envelope information in some header (not all do).  Even if this
-information is present in the headers, the process can
-be error-prone and is dependent upon the specific mail server used
-for mail retrieval.  Multidrop-mode is used when more than one local
-user is specified for a particular server account in the configuration
-file.  Note that the forgoing discussion of singledrop- and
-multidrop-modes does not apply to the ESMTP ETRN or ODMR retrieval
-methods, since they are based upon the SMTP protocol which
-specifically provides the envelope recipient to \fIfetchmail\fR.
+As each message is retrieved, \fBfetchmail\fP normally delivers it via
+SMTP to port 25 on the machine it is running on (localhost), just as
+though it were being passed in over a normal TCP/IP link.
+\fBfetchmail\fP provides the SMTP server with an envelope recipient
+derived in the manner described previously.  The mail will then be
+delivered according to your MTA's rules (the Mail Transfer Agent is
+usually \fBsendmail\fP(8), \fBexim\fP(8), or \fBpostfix\fP(8)).
+Invoking your system's MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) is the duty of your
+MTA.  All the delivery-control mechanisms (such as \fI.forward\fP files)
+normally available through your system MTA and local delivery agents
+will therefore be applied as usual.

 If a

 daemon is running as root, SIGUSR1 wakes it up from its sleep phase and
 forces a poll of all non-skipped servers. For compatibility reasons,
 SIGHUP can also be used in 6.3.X but may not be available in future
 fetchmail versions.
