 SSL server requirements

+In order to let any mail client (not just fetchmail) verify server certificates 
+properly, so that users can be sure their connection is not eavesdropped, there 
+are several requirements that need to be fulfilled.
 
 1. Match certificate and DNS names:
 
-   The server certificate's &quot;common name&quot; or &quot;subject alternative name&quot;
-   must match the name by which clients are connecting. Avoid the use of
-   wildmats if possible, not all clients support them (fetchmail does).

-   This may sound trivial, but for load balancing and failover setups,
-   it may not be obvious.

 2. Provide the *full* certificate chain
 
-   Many SSL documents tell you to install the server certificate,
-   silently assuming that it were directly signed by a trusted
-   root certification authority (CA).

-   If your server certificate is not directly signed by the root
-   certification authority (root CA), then you are using intermediate
-   CA. In this case, you *MUST* (as per the TLS standard) provide *ALL*
-   intermediate certificates.

-   If you fail to provide intermediate certificates, clients can only
-   connect if the end user overrides/disables security warnings in
-   his/her software, and this disables the detection of eavesdroppers.

 3. Provide the *root* CA's certificate separately.
 
-   Provide the root CA's certificate in a place where your end users
-   will quickly and easily find it, or provide a link to it. Depending
-   on which mail software your clients use, it may not be pre-installed,
-   and users require this root CA to verify your SSL server certificate,
-   and possibly intermediate certificates.
