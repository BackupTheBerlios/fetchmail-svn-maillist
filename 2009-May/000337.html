+fetchmail README
+================
 
-Fetchmail is a free, full-featured, robust, well-documented remote
-mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended to be used over
-on-demand TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections).  It
-retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it to your local
-(client) machine's delivery system, so it can then be be read by
-normal mail user agents such as elm(1) or Mail(1).
+Introduction
+------------
 
-Fetchmail supports all standard mail-retrieval protocols in use on the
-Internet: POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, IMAP2bis, IMAP4, IMAP4rev1
-ESMTP ETRN, and ODMR.  Fetchmail also fully supports authentication
-via GSSAPI, Kerberos 4 and 5, RFC1938 one-time passwords, Compuserve's
-POP3 with RPA, Microsoft's NTLM, Demon Internet's SDPS, or CRAM-MD5
-authentication a la RFC2195.  Fetchmail also supports end-to-end
-encryption with OpenSSL.

+Mail(1).
 
-The fetchmail code was developed under Linux, but has also been
-extensively tested under the BSD variants, AIX, HP-UX versions 9 and
-10, SunOS, Solaris, NEXTSTEP, OSF 3.2, IRIX, and Rhapsody.

+(also IMAP4, IMAP2bis), POP2, IMAP4, ETRN, and ODMR. On the output side, 
+fetchmail supports ESMTP/SMTP, LMTP, and invocation of a local delivery agent.

+Fetchmail supports end-to-end encryption with OpenSSL, do read README.SSL for 
+details on fetchmail's configuration and README.SSL-SERVER for server-side 
+requirements.  NOTE! To be compatible with earlier releases, fetchmail 6.3's 
+default behaviour is more relaxed than dictated by the standard - add options 
+such as --sslcertck to tighten certificate checking.
+
+Portability
+-----------
+
+The fetchmail code was developed under Linux, but has also been extensively 
+tested under the BSD variants, AIX, HP-UX versions 9 and 10, SunOS, Solaris, 
+NEXTSTEP, OSF 3.2, IRIX, and Rhapsody.
+
+It should be readily portable to other Unix variants and Unix-like operating 
+systems (it uses GNU autoconf).  It has been ported to Cygwin, LynxOS and BeOS 
+and will build there without special action.  It has also been ported to QNX; 
+to build under QNX, see the header comments in the Makefile.  It is reported to 
 build and run under AmigaOS.
 
-See the distribution files FEATURES for a full list of features, NEWS
-for detailed information on recent changes, NOTES for design notes, and
-TODO for a list of things that still need doing.
+Further reading
+---------------
 
 The INSTALL file describes how to configure and install fetchmail.
 
-The fetchmail code appears to be stable and free of bugs affecting
-normal operation (that is, retrieving from POP3 or IMAP in single-drop
-mode and forwarding via SMTP to sendmail).  It will probably undergo
-substantial change only if and when support for a new retrieval
-protocol or authentication mode is added.

+Status, source code
+-------------------
 
+The fetchmail code appears to be stable and free of bugs affecting normal 
+operation (that is, retrieving from POP3 or IMAP in single-drop mode and
