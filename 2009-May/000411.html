+Beginning with fetchmail 6.3.10, the SMTP client uses the recommended minimum
+timeouts from RFC-5321 while waiting for the SMTP/LMTP server it is talking to.
+You can raise the timeouts even more, but you cannot shorten it. This is to
+avoid a painful situation where fetchmail has been configured with a short
+timeout (a minute or less), ships a long message (many MBytes) to the local
+MTA, which then takes longer than timeout to respond &quot;OK&quot;, which it eventually
+will; that would mean the mail gets delivered properly, but fetchmail cannot
+notice it and will thus refetch this big message over and over again.

 Fetchmail will write to the plugin's stdin and read from the plugin's
 stdout.
